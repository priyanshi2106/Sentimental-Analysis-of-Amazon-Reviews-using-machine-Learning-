# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Amazon-Reviews-using-machine-Learning-

•	Implemented Sentimental Analysis of Amazon Reviews model using Machine Learning.  
•	Aim was to develop a model that can categorize reviews into positive and negative by deploying Machine Learning models. 
•	Executed a BERT transformer-based model (developed at Google in 2018) as NLP model and implemented various ML models. Target is to see how these models will fare against each other based on f-scores on train and test sets and train and test times.  
•	Managed to achieve a model that can predict sentiment of unseen reviews, with a high degree of accuracy and  f-score of 94%.
